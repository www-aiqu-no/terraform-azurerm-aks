# v0.1.3 (Unreleased)

# v0.1.2 (February 06, 2020)
#### NOTES
- SIMPLIFIED module... Like, a lot. Removed all submodules. Tried adding basic
  management of the deployed cluster, but ran into problems with provider & empty credentials. Keeping things separate is best, I now believe.. Do this in another module! Use this one to deploy the cluster & logging, then export the credentials for modifying your cluster.
